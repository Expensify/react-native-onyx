# `react-native-onyx`
Awesome persistent storage solution wrapped in a Pub/Sub library.

# Features

- Onyx stores and retrieves data from persistent storage
- Data is stored as key/value pairs, where the value can be anything from a single piece of data to a complex object
- Collections of data are usually not stored as a single key (e.g. an array with multiple objects), but as individual keys+ID (e.g. `report_1234`, `report_4567`, etc.). Store collections as individual keys when a component will bind directly to one of those keys. For example: reports are stored as individual keys because `SidebarLink.js` binds to the individual report keys for each link. However, report actions are stored as an array of objects because nothing binds directly to a single report action.
- Onyx allows other code to subscribe to changes in data, and then publishes change events whenever data is changed
- Anything needing to read Onyx data needs to:
    1. Know what key the data is stored in (for web, you can find this by looking in the JS console > Application > local storage)
    2. Subscribe to changes of the data for a particular key or set of keys. React components use `withOnyx()` and non-React libs use `Onyx.connect()`.
    3. Get initialized with the current value of that key from persistent storage (Onyx does this by calling `setState()` or triggering the `callback` with the values currently on disk as part of the connection process)
- Subscribing to Onyx keys is done using a constant defined in `ONYXKEYS`. Each Onyx key represents either a collection of items or a specific entry in storage. For example, since all reports are stored as individual keys like `report_1234`, if code needs to know about all the reports (e.g. display a list of them in the nav menu), then it would subscribe to the key `ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT`.

# Getting Started

## Installation

Onyx is published to [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-onyx)

```shell
npm install react-native-onyx --save
```

## Initialization

To initialize Onyx we call `Onyx.init()` with a configuration object.

```javascript
import Onyx from 'react-native-onyx';

const ONYXKEYS = {
    SESSION: 'session',
};

const config = {
    keys: ONYXKEYS,
};

Onyx.init(config);
```

### Usage in non react-native projects
Onyx can be used in non react-native projects, by leveraging the `browser` field in `package.json`
Bundlers like Webpack respect that field and import code from the specified path
We import Onyx the same way shown above - `import Onyx from 'react-native-onyx'`

## Setting data

To store some data we can use the `Onyx.set()` method.

```javascript
API.Authenticate(params)
    .then((response) => {
        Onyx.set(ONYXKEYS.SESSION, {token: response.token});
    });
```

The data will then be cached and stored via [`AsyncStorage`](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage).

## Merging data

We can also use `Onyx.merge()` to merge new `Object` or `Array` data in with existing data.

For `Array` the default behavior is to replace it fully, effectively making it equivalent to set:

```javascript
Onyx.merge(ONYXKEYS.EMPLOYEE_LIST, ['Joe']); // -> ['Joe']
Onyx.merge(ONYXKEYS.EMPLOYEE_LIST, ['Jack']); // -> ['Jack']
```

For `Object` values the default behavior uses `lodash/merge` under the hood to do a deep extend of the object.

```javascript
Onyx.merge(ONYXKEYS.POLICY, {id: 1}); // -> {id: 1}
Onyx.merge(ONYXKEYS.POLICY, {name: 'My Workspace'}); // -> {id: 1, name: 'My Workspace'}
```

Arrays inside objects will be replaced fully, same as arrays not inside objects:

```javascript
Onyx.merge(ONYXKEYS.POLICY, {employeeList: ['Joe', 'Jack']}); // -> {employeeList: ['Joe', 'Jack']}
Onyx.merge(ONYXKEYS.POLICY, {employeeList: ['Jack']}); // -> {employeeList: ['Jack']}
```

### Should I use `merge()` or `set()` or both?

- Use `merge()` when creating a new object
- Use `merge()` to merge partial data into an existing object
- Use `merge()` when storing simple values (`String`, `Boolean`, `Number`)
- Use `set()` when you need to delete an Onyx key completely from storage
- Use `set()` when you need to completely reset an object or array of data

Consecutive calls to `Onyx.merge()` with the same key are batched in a stack and processed in the order that they were called. This helps avoid race conditions where one merge possibly finishes before another. However, it's important to note that calls to `Onyx.set()` are not batched together with calls to `Onyx.merge()`. For this reason, it is usually preferable to use one or the other, but not both. Onyx is a work-in-progress so always test code to make sure assumptions are correct!

### Should I store things as an array or an object?

You should avoid arrays as much as possible. They do not work well with `merge()` because it can't update a single element in an array, it must always set the entire array each time. This forces you to use `set()` a lot, and as seen above, `merge()` is more performant and better to use in almost any situation. If you are working with an array of objects, then you should be using an Onyx collection because it's optimized for working with arrays of objects.

## Subscribing to data changes

To set up a basic subscription for a given key use the `Onyx.connect()` method.

```javascript
let session;
const connectionID = Onyx.connect({
    key: ONYXKEYS.SESSION,
    callback: (val) => session = val || {},
});
```

To teardown the subscription call `Onyx.disconnect()` with the `connectionID` returned from `Onyx.connect()`. It's recommended to clean up subscriptions anytime you are connecting from within a function to prevent memory leaks.

```javascript
Onyx.disconnect(connectionID);
```

We can also access values inside React components via the `withOnyx()` [higher order component](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html). When the data changes the component will re-render.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import {withOnyx} from 'react-native-onyx';

const App = ({session}) => (
    <View>
        {session.token ? <Text>Logged in</Text> : <Text>Logged out</Text> }
    </View>
);

export default withOnyx({
    session: {
        key: ONYXKEYS.SESSION,
    },
})(App);
```

While `Onyx.connect()` gives you more control on how your component reacts as data is fetched from disk, `withOnyx()` will delay the rendering of the wrapped component until all keys/entities have been fetched and passed to the component, this can be convenient for simple cases. This however, can really delay your application if many entities are connected to the same component, you can pass an `initialValue` to each key to allow Onyx to eagerly render your component with this value.

```javascript
export default withOnyx({
    session: {
        key: ONYXKEYS.SESSION,
        initialValue: {}
    },
})(App);
```

Additionally, if your component has many keys/entities when your component will mount but will receive many updates as data is fetched from DB and passed down to it, as every key that gets fetched will trigger a `setState` on the `withOnyx` HOC. This might cause re-renders on the initial mounting, preventing the component from mounting/rendering in reasonable time, making your app feel slow and even delaying animations. You can workaround this by passing an additional object with the `shouldDelayUpdates` property set to true. Onyx will then put all the updates in a queue until you decide when then should be applied, the component will receive a function `markReadyForHydration`. A good place to call this function is on the `onLayout` method, which gets triggered after your component has been rendered.

```javascript
const App = ({session, markReadyForHydration}) => (
    <View onLayout={() => markReadyForHydration()}>
        {session.token ? <Text>Logged in</Text> : <Text>Logged out</Text> }
    </View>
);

// Second argument to funciton is `shouldDelayUpdates`
export default withOnyx({
    session: {
        key: ONYXKEYS.SESSION,
        initialValue: {}
    },
}, true)(App);
```

### Dependent Onyx Keys and withOnyx()
Some components need to subscribe to multiple Onyx keys at once and sometimes, one key might rely on the data from another key. This is similar to a JOIN in SQL.

Example: To get the policy of a report, the `policy` key depends on the `report` key.

```javascript
export default withOnyx({
    report: {
        key: ({reportID) => `${ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT}${reportID}`,
    },
    policy: {
        key: ({report}) => `${ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.POLICY}${report.policyID}`,
    },
})(App);
```

Background info:
- The `key` value can be a function that returns the key that Onyx subscribes to
- The first argument to the `key` function is the `props` from the component

**Detailed explanation of how this is handled and rendered:**
1. The component mounts with a `reportID={1234}` prop
2. `withOnyx` evaluates the mapping
3. `withOnyx` connects to the key `reports_1234` because of the prop passed to the component
3. `withOnyx` connects to the key `policies_undefined` because `report` doesn't exist in the props yet, so the `policyID` defaults to `undefined`. * (see note below)
4. Onyx reads the data and updates the state of `withOnyx` with:
    - `report={{reportID: 1234, policyID: 1, ... the rest of the object ...}}`
    - `policy={undefined}` (since there is no policy with ID `undefined`)
5. There is still an `undefined` key in the mapping, so Onyx reads the data again
6. This time `withOnyx` connects to the key `policies_1` because the `report` object exists in the component's state and it has a `policyID: 1`
7. Onyx reads the data and updates the state of withOnyx with:
    - `policy={{policyID: 1, ... the rest of the object ...}`
8. Now all mappings have values that are defined (not undefined) and the component is rendered with all necessary data
  
* It is VERY important to NOT use empty string default values like `report.policyID || ''`. This results in the key returned to `withOnyx` as `policies_` which subscribes to the ENTIRE POLICY COLLECTION and is most assuredly not what you were intending. You can use a default of `0` (as long as you are reasonably sure that there is never a policyID=0). This allows Onyx to return `undefined` as the value of the policy key, which is handled by `withOnyx` appropriately.

DO NOT use more than one `withOnyx` component at a time. It adds overhead and prevents some optimizations like batched rendering from working to its full potential.

It's also beneficial to use a [selector](https://github.com/Expensify/react-native-onyx/blob/main/API.md#connectmapping--number) with the mapping in case you need to grab a single item in a collection (like a single report action).

## Collections

Collections allow keys with similar value types to be subscribed together by subscribing to the collection key. To define one, it must be included in the `ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION` object and it must be suffixed with an underscore. Member keys should use a unique identifier or index after the collection key prefix (e.g. `report_42`).

```javascript
const ONYXKEYS = {
    COLLECTION: {
        REPORT: 'report_',
    },
};
```

### Setting Collection Values

To save a new collection key we can either do:

```js
Onyx.merge(`${ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT}${report1.reportID}`, report1);
```

or we can set many at once with `mergeCollection()` (see below for guidance on best practices):

```js
Onyx.mergeCollection(ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT, {
    [`${ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT}${report1.reportID}`]: report1,
    [`${ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT}${report2.reportID}`]: report2,
    [`${ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT}${report3.reportID}`]: report3,
});
```

### Subscribing to Collections

There are several ways to subscribe to these keys:

```javascript
withOnyx({
    allReports: {key: ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT},
})(MyComponent);
```

This will add a prop to the component called `allReports` which is an object of collection member key/values. Changes to the individual member keys will modify the entire object and new props will be passed with each individual key update. The prop doesn't update on the initial rendering of the component until the entire collection has been read out of Onyx.

```js
Onyx.connect({key: ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT}, callback: (memberValue, memberKey) => {...}});
```

This will fire the callback once per member key depending on how many collection member keys are currently stored. Changes to those keys after the initial callbacks fire will occur when each individual key is updated.

```js
Onyx.connect({
    key: ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT,
    waitForCollectionCallback: true,
    callback: (allReports) => {...}},
});
```

This final option forces `Onyx.connect()` to behave more like `withOnyx()` and only update the callback once with the entire collection initially and later with an updated version of the collection when individual keys update.

### Performance Considerations When Using Collections

Be cautious when using collections as things can get out of hand if you have a subscriber hooked up to a collection key that has large numbers of individual keys. If this is the case, it is critical to use `mergeCollection()` over `merge()`.

Remember, `mergeCollection()` will notify a subscriber only *once* with the total collected values whereas each call to `merge()` would re-render a connected component *each time it is called*. Consider this example where `reports` is an array of reports that we want to index and save.

```js
// Bad
_.each(reports, report => Onyx.merge(`${ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT}${report.reportID}`, report)); // -> A component using withOnyx() will have it's state updated with each iteration

// Good
const values = {};
_.each(reports, report => values[`${ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT}${report.reportID}`] = report);
Onyx.mergeCollection(ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT, values); // -> A component using withOnyx() will only have it's state updated once
```

## Clean up

To clear all data from `Onyx` we can use `Onyx.clear()`.

```javascript
function signOut() {
    Onyx.clear();
}
```

## Storage Providers
`Onyx.get`, `Onyx.set`, and the rest of the API accesses the underlying storage
differently depending on the platform

Under the hood storage access calls are delegated to a [`StorageProvider`](lib/storage/index.web.js)
Some platforms (like web and desktop) might use the same storage provider

If a platform needs to use a separate library (like using MMVK for react-native) it should be added in the following way:
1. Create a `StorageProvider.js` at [lib/storage/providers](lib/storage/providers)
   Reference an existing [StorageProvider](lib/storage/providers/AsyncStorage.js) for the interface that has to be implemented
2. Update the factory at [lib/storage/index.web.js](lib/storage/index.web.js) and [lib/storage/index.native.js](lib/storage/index.native.js) to return the newly created Provider for the desired Platform(s)

# API Reference

[Docs](./API.md)

# Storage Eviction

Different platforms come with varying storage capacities and Onyx has a way to gracefully fail when those storage limits are encountered. When Onyx fails to set or modify a key the following steps are taken:
1. Onyx looks at a list of recently accessed keys (access is defined as subscribed to or modified) and locates the key that was least recently accessed
2. It then deletes this key and retries the original operation

By default, Onyx will not evict anything from storage and will presume all keys are "unsafe" to remove unless explicitly told otherwise.

**To flag a key as safe for removal:**
- Add the key to the `safeEvictionKeys` option in `Onyx.init(options)`
- Implement `canEvict` in the Onyx config for each component subscribing to a key
- The key will only be deleted when all subscribers return `true` for `canEvict`

e.g.
```js
Onyx.init({
    safeEvictionKeys: [ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT_ACTIONS],
});
```

```js
export default withOnyx({
    reportActions: {
        key: ({reportID}) => `${ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT_ACTIONS}${reportID}_`,
        canEvict: props => !props.isActiveReport,
    },
})(ReportActionsView);
```

# Benchmarks

Provide the `captureMetrics` boolean flag to `Onyx.init` to capture call statistics

```js
Onyx.init({
    keys: ONYXKEYS,
    safeEvictionKeys: [ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT_ACTIONS],
    captureMetrics: Config.BENCHMARK_ONYX,
});
```

At any point you can get the collected statistics using `Onyx.getMetrics()`.
This will return an object containing `totalTime`, `averageTime` and `summaries`.
`summaries` is a collection of statistics for each method it contains data about:
  - method name
  - total, max, min, average times for this method calls
  - calls - a list of individual calls with each having: start time; end time; call duration; call arguments
    - start/end times are relative to application launch time - 0.00 being exactly at launch

If you wish to reset the metrics and start over use `Onyx.resetMetrics()`

Finally, there's a `Onyx.printMetrics()` method which prints human statistics information on the dev console. You can use this method during debugging. For example add an `Onyx.printMetrics()` line somewhere in code or call it through the dev console. It supports 3 popular formats *MD* - human friendly markdown, *CSV* and *JSON*. The default is MD if you want to print another format call `Onyx.printMetrics({ format: 'csv' })` or
`Onyx.printMetrics({ format: 'json' })`.

Sample output of `Onyx.printMetrics()`

```

# Debug mode

It can be useful to log why Onyx is calling `setState()` on a particular React component so that we can understand which key changed, what changed about the value, and the connected component that ultimately rendered as a result. When used correctly this can help isolate problem areas and unnecessary renders in the code. To enable this feature, pass `debugSetState: true` to the config and grep JS console logs for `[Onyx-Debug]`.

# Development

`react-native` bundles source using the `metro` bundler. `metro` does not follow symlinks, so we can't use `npm link` to
link a local version of Onyx during development

To quickly test small changes you can directly go to `node_modules/react-native-onyx` in the parent project and:
- tweak original source if you're testing over a react-native project
- tweak `dist/web.development.js` for non react-native-projects

To continuously work on Onyx we have to set up a task that copies content to parent project's `node_modules/react-native-onyx`:
1. Work on Onyx feature or a fix
2. Save files
3. Optional: run `npm run build` (if you're working or want to test on a non react-native project)
   - `npm link` would actually work outside of `react-native` and it can be used to link Onyx locally for a web only project
4. Copy Onyx to consumer project's `node_modules/react-native-onyx`

# Automated Tests

There are Playwright e2e tests implemented for the web. To run them:

- in the tests/e2e/app directory, run `npm install`
- `npm run e2e` to run the e2e tests
- or `npm run e2e-ui` to run the e2e tests in UI mode
